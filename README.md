# Design-and-Verification-of-Synchronous-FIFO-using-SystemVerilog
Overview
This project implements a Synchronous First-In-First-Out (FIFO) module using SystemVerilog. The Synchronous FIFO is a digital circuit that stores and retrieves data in a First-In-First-Out order. It is commonly used in digital systems to manage data transfer between different clock domains.

Features
Synchronous Operation: The FIFO operates synchronously with a clock signal.
Configurable Size: You can customize the depth of the FIFO to meet your specific requirements.
Full and Empty Flags: The FIFO provides flags to indicate when it is full or empty.
Parallel Read and Write Ports: The design supports parallel read and write operations.
Simple Interface: The interface is designed to be straightforward and easy to use.
